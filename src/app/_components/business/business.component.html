    <p class="section__description">Each LEL is slightly customized to properly fit into your supply chain and
      manufacturing process. The
      LOOMIA
      Lab program takes you from concept to a pilot production run. We work with our customers to go from lab
      prototype, to pilot production, to scale production. Our LEL has been designed for easy integration,
      meaning
      that <strong>your product maintains your existing supply chain at scale.</strong></p>
